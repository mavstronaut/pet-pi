1 Can I call the methods that trigger on event as a function? 
    Should I just define them separately as a function?

2 Where should the hardcoded file be located?
    What is wrong with my logic in Books.js to call it? 
        * I think it's in a try{} catch{} in the event
        * and that the render is written in a similar illegal way

3 Managing the state so that the form work to send the input change

4 Fix API call to findAllSaved, page won't load because .find() returns a null value (There already is a .catch() method used)

5 Fix Login component: 
    collapse on click? - or - dom-switch and route to a different page
    form needs its own event to handle change, store input in the state
        Does the react render file need to import bcrypt to be secure?
    needs event to handle form submission and make the API call for login

6 Finish implementation for login permission to play in soundController.js
    I have a plan/guide for this, aim to do the other things first.
